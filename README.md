# EvE Production Suite - Version 1.1.x

EvE Production Suite is a set of Google and GESI tools to quickly and easily manage production, budget and basic corporate 
management with installing servers or adding any RL costs to your game play. To do this we are using Google Sheets, Script Editor and
eventually moving this data to a Google Sites setup that pulls the information for the sheets in a nice, easy to use, format for the corp.

The final picture of the suite (why it's called a suite) is that we will end up with a single main module - the Corporate Management Module, in where all ESIs are pulled and updated. From here we plan on seperating Capital, Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3, Structure, Equiptment, etc into seperate modules. The first module to be released will be our Buyback Module. 

Modules are not required - you simply add the module you need based on your corporations setup. If you don't produce Capitals, why have capital production sheets? Modules however **CAN NOT** fuction without the main 'Corporate Management Module'

As of **NOW** - You may see some references to 'Corporate Management Module' - or seperate modules, however we have only released the 'Corporate Management Module' and the 'Buyback Module' as of 7/28/2018. 

This project took us months of daily coding to create and even more to test and change. If you are feeling kind hearted than donations can be sent via Isk (in-game) to Shey Danu. Thank you so much, your helping me by donating. :)
