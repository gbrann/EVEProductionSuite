# EVEProductionSuite
Eve Online - Production Suite is a set of Google and ESI tools to quickly and easily manage production, budget and basic corporate 
management with installing servers or adding any RL costs to your game play. To do this we are using Google Sheets, Script Editor and
eventually moving this data to a Google Sites setup that pulls the information for the sheets in a nice, easy to use, format for the corp.

To Install: (NOT CURRENTLY AVALIABLE)

This is a for donation project - donations can be sent via Isk (in-game) to Shey Danu. Thank you so much, your helping me by donating. :)
